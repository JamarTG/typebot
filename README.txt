Pyautogui is controlling the typing so 
if you shift the bot away before it is
finished it will continue to type

You need to have a webdriver installed 
and you should paste the path inside of
the path variable

This types at a max speed of 102 because 
it only grabs 2 paragraph. Repeat the 
process if you want more paragraph

Ensure that the cookie image is the same as
the one your bot is seeing on the screen
